# FileConsolidation
file consolidation tool

This tool will take all files in the current directory and all sub directories
and copy them into a new directory named CompiledDirectory. If two files have
the same name, the program will only copy over one version. The program does 
not copy hidden files or the program itself. I wrote this program to allow
me to bring all of my music into one folder in which I could then sort and
process them. The program can be run multiple times if changes have occurred.
If CompiledDirectory already exists, the files will simpy be copied into it.
This tool is useful if you have a large number of files hidden inside a complex
tree of directories and subdirectories and wish to simply view all of the files
inside a single directory and all of its subdirectories.
