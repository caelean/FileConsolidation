# FileConsolidation
file consolidation tool

This tool will take all files in the current directory and all sub directories
and copy them into a new directory named CompiledDirectory. If two files have
the same name, the program will only copy over one version. The program does 
not copy hidden files or the program itself. I wrote this program to allow
me to bring all of my music into one folder in which I could then sort and
process them. The program can be run multiple times if changes have occurred.
If CompiledDirectory already exists, the files will simpy be copied into it.
